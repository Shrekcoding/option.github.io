    <h2>Options I chose</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Multi-column layout. I integrated this into how I wanted my pictures to display so that for computers it would be three pictures across while on mobile devices just one picture is displayed per column.</li>
        <li>@font face rule. I integrated this into my footers so that my footers displayed a different font than the default font. this was done in options.css and was stated as @font-face {font-family: myFirstFont; src: url(sansation_light.woff);} </li>
        <li>Text and box shadows. For this, I integrated text shadows on all my headers and footers as well as box shadows on all my images. This is done with a box and text shadow function such as box-shadow: 5px 10px purple; or text-shadow: 4px 4px #FF0000;. </li>
        <li>linear gradient. I used a linear gradient for the header, footer, and background section which transitions from black to blue. This was done by implementing background-image: linear-gradient(black, blue); into the CSS</li>
        <li>CSS attribute. For the CSS atributes, I decided to give my pictures each a colored border that would correspond to their species. for that, I gave each bird picture a title of bird, each cat picture a title of cats, and each dog picture a title of dogs. Then, I applied the coloring in option.css by calling out those attributes.</li>
        <li>CSS filters. For each image, I applied a css filter such as grayscale and color saturation. Giving an element a filter is rather quite simple, and an example can be as simple as .grayscale {filter: grayscale(100%);}. You can also change the picure's brightness and invert the color scheme by following the same process, all of which is implemented in this module.</li>
